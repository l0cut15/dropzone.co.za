<p align="left">The thought of crawling out onto struts and wires hundreds of feet above
the earth, and then giving up even that tenuous hold of safety and of substance, left me a
feeling of anticipation mixed with dread, of confidence restrained by caution, of courage
salted through with fear. How tightly should one hold onto life? How loosely give it rein?
I would have to pay in money for hurling my body into space. There would be no crowd to
applaud and watch my landing. Nor was there any scientific objective to be gained. No,
there was a deeper reason for wanting to jump, a desire I could not explain.....it was a
love of the air and sky and flying, the lure of adventure, the appreciation of beauty. It
lay beyond the descriptive words of man--where immortality is touched through danger,
where life meets death on equal plane; where man is more than man, and existence both
supreme and valueless at the same instant. <br>
--Charles A. Lindbergh (1902-1974) </p>
