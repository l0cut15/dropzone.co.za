<p>The Witbank Skydiving Club offers two methods of getting into the air for the first
time: 

<ul>
  <li><a HREF="training.htm#Static Line">Static Line Instruction</a></li>
  <li><a HREF="training.htm#Accelerated Free Fall">Accelerated Free Fall Instruction</a></li>
  <li><a HREF="training.htm#Tandem">Tandem Skydiving</a></li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a HREF="training.htm#Equipment">equipment</a> section on this page for an
overview of the student equipment used by the club. <br>

<h4><a NAME="Static Line"></a><font SIZE="+2">Static Line</font> </h4>

<p>Static Line instruction is the longest established method of skydiving instruction and
still the most popular at Witbank. Before making a static line jump all students are given
an instructional course covering all aspects of their first jump, this course generally
takes a full day. Once all instruction is complete the students are ready for their first
static line jump - in this form of jump the students parachute is attached to the plane
via a static line. When the students exits the plane the static line pulls the parachute
out of the container and deploys it - there is no need for the student to pull a rip cord.
After doing three &quot;no-load&quot; static line jumps, where the student does nothing
more than exit the aircraft, the student is placed on to dummy rip-cord pulls. On a dummy
rip-cord jump the student is still attached to the plane via the static line but they also
have a dummy rip-cord with which they must demonstrate their ability to succesfully pull a
rip-cord and deploy their parachute for themselves. After five consecutive succesful dummy
rip-cord pulls the student is cleared for freefall and the fun really begins! </p>

<p>A static line course is held every Saturday morning. Just arrive at the DZ by 8:30.</p>

<h4><a NAME="Tandem"></a><font SIZE="+2">Tandem</font> <img src="../images/training/tandem.gif" alt="Tandem" WIDTH="170" HEIGHT="119"></h4>

<p>If you are not sure if skydiving is for you and want to try it out before commiting
yourself to a full course, or just want to experience freefall once, then tandem is for
you. In a tandem jump you are attached to a tandem instructor via a special two person
harness which is connected to an extra large parachute especially designed to carry two
people. Tandem jumps require only a short (45 minute) instruction course and then you are
straight in to freefall from 9,500 feet. The club also has available video camermen who
can accompany you on your ride and film the whole lot, facial expressions and all. </p>

<p>Tandem skydives require booking, please call the DZ or send us an <a href="mailto:blueskies@khaoz.co.za">e-mail.</a></p>
