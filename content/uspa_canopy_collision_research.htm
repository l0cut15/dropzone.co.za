My sister-in-law's uncle told her this one, but she swears it's a true story. <br>
The USPA was getting concerned about the recent trends in high performance canopy design
and the implications they have for the outcome of midair canopy collisions and proper
canopy collision posture. Specifically they were concerned with whether jumpers should
'get big' in the event of a collision or 'get small.' One question that needed answering
was; would microline suspension lines really sever limbs, at the closing speeds
encountered with modern high performance canopies? <br>
<br>
They initially approached the army parachute team to perform these tests. The Golden
Knights, understandably, declined to participate. <br>
<br>
Next they approached the FAA to get a waiver allowing them to perform the tests using
tandem rigs and cadavers. The FAA declined for fear that that severed cadaver parts might
fall into populated areas and be mistaken for airline crash victims. <br>
<br>
The FAA did however offer to loan the USPA researchers their aircraft/avian collision test
cannon. This is a compressed air cannon capable of firing a chicken at speeds sufficient
to simulate a midair collision between an aircraft and a flying bird. The device is used
by the FAA to test aircraft canopies and engines. <br>
<br>
Armed with this high tech chicken cannon, the USPA researchers proceeded to set up the
rest of their experimental apparatus. First they built a support frame, from which they
suspended a grid of microline. Next they aligned and adjusted the cannon to hurtle the
chicken at the grid at a speed of sixty miles per hour. <br>
<br>
Question: would the chicken bounce off the microline as the proponents of the 'get big'
approach theorized or would it be sliced into pieces as the 'get small' advocates feared? <br>
<br>
Well, they loaded a chicken into the cannon and fired it... <br>
<br>
The chicken went through the microline snapping it like rigger's seal thread, tore through
the frame of the test device, hurled across the laboratory and lodged itself in the cinder
block wall at the far end. Needless to say the researchers were somewhat puzzled by the
results, so they took their data back to the FAA and asked them to verify that the cannon
was indeed working correctly. <br>
<br>
The FAA analyzed the data, informed USPA researchers that the cannon was working
correctly, and recommended that they repeat their experiment using a thawed chicken. <br>
<br>
Hard to believe, I know, but it must be true, my brother-in-law's aunt wouldn't make up
something like this. </p>
