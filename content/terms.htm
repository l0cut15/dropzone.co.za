    Also see <a href="facilities.htm#party">party</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Bounce</strong> - To land after freefall without the aid of a parachute.</li>
  <li><b>Burble </b>- Area of low air pressure above a descending skydiver. Going into someone
    else's burble usually results in a <a HREF="terms.htm#Frommel">frommel</a>.</li>
  <li><a NAME="Canopy"></a><b>Canopy </b>- What skydivers call their parachute</li>
  <li><a NAME="Drop Zone"></a><b>Drop Zone</b> - Where the skydiving and partying takes
    place.&nbsp; Abbreviated DZ.</li>
  <li><b>First </b>- A word never mentioned at the <a HREF="terms.htm#Drop Zone">dropzone</a>
    unless you want to buy <a HREF="terms.htm#Beer">beer</a></li>
  <li><a NAME="Formation Skydiving"></a><b>Formation Skydiving</b> - Skydiving discipline in
    which two or more skydivers join together in different positions to make different
    formations. Previously known as relative work</li>
  <li><b>Freestyle </b>- Skydiving discipline where participants go out and perform freestyle
    dance like movements - <a HREF="terms.htm#Formation Skydiving">formation skydiving</a>
    stalwarts reckon this is just because they cant get stable</li>
  <li><a NAME="Frommel"></a><b>Frommel </b>- What happens when a formation skydive self
    destructs</li>
  <li><b>Hacky </b>- Game in which a group of skydivers attempt to keep a small hacksack
    (beanbag) in the air for as long as possible by kicking it. Breaking any of the myriad of
    obscure but sacred hacking rules results in the offending skydiver having his bum kicked
    by the rest of the hackers. Also known as &quot;A game played with a ball that doesn't
    bounce by people who might&quot;.</li>
  <li><a NAME="Hook turn"></a><b>Hook turn</b> - A sudden turn close to the ground used to
    build up speed for a spectacular <a HREF="terms.htm#Turf Surf">turf surf</a> and gentle
    landing. When misjudged can result in smashed bones and a lengthy stay in hospital.&nbsp;
    The animation on the right hand side of this page shows a hook turn.</li>
  <li><b>Party </b>- What skydivers like to do when the skydiving finishes for the day.
    Generally involves the consumption of much <a HREF="terms.htm#Beer">beer</a>.</li>
  <li><a NAME="Pilot Chute"></a><b>Pilot Chute</b> - Small parachute attached to the main
    parachute that is used to remove the main from the harness and fill it with air.</li>
  <li><b>Ram air </b>- A modern &quot;square&quot; parachute, these inflate with air and take
    on an aerodynamic profile, much like an aircraft's wing, allowing them to be flown rather
    than just descending like an old style <a HREF="terms.htm#Round">round</a> parachute.</li>
  <li><a NAME="Reserve"></a><b>Reserve </b>- The &quot;spare&quot; emergency parachute carried
    by all skydivers in case their main <a HREF="terms.htm#Canopy">canopy </a>has a
    malfunction</li>
  <li><b>Rip Cord</b> - The small handle used to deploy a spring loaded pilot chute on a
    student freefall rig. Most expert rigs use a <a HREF="terms.htm#Throw Out">throwout </a>or
    pull out pilot chute instead.</li>
  <li><a NAME="Round"></a><b>Round </b>- An old style of parachute canopy, these were
    difficult or impossible to steer and tended to land the user rather hard. Now generally
    only used for a <a HREF="terms.htm#Reserve">reserve </a>(and even this is becoming rare).</li>
  <li><a NAME="RSL"></a><b>RSL </b>- Reserve Static Line, a backup device for automatically
    deploying the <a HREF="terms.htm#Reserve">reserve </a>if the skydiver cuts away their main
    <a HREF="terms.htm#Canopy">canopy</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Static Line</b> - A line attaching the parachute to the plane, used to automatically
    deploy the parachute as soon as the parachutist exits the plane. Used to train students.</li>
  <li><a NAME="Throw Out"></a><b>Throw Out - </b>A type of <a HREF="terms.htm#Pilot Chute">pilot
    chute</a> that the skydiver actually throws into the air rather than an old style spring
    loaded <a HREF="terms.htm#Pilot Chute">pilot chute</a></li>
  <li><a NAME="Turf Surf"></a><b>Turf Surf</b> - A long, flat skim across the grass and gentle
    landing that follows a properly timed and executed high performance landing (see <a HREF="terms.htm#Hook turn">hookturn</a>) . When mistimed the result is a turf eat.</li>
  <li><b>Whuffo</b> - Derogatory term for a non-jumper, comes from the typical non-jumper
    question &quot;What for you want to jump out of a perfectly good airplane?&quot; to which
    of course the answer is &quot;because the door was open&quot;.</li>
