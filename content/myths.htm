</ol>

<p><b>You Can Talk In Freefall</b></p>

<p>Not unless you have one heck of a loud voice. In <a HREF="terms.htm#Freefall">freefall</a>
you are moving at about 220Km/h and the wind noise is incredibly loud. If you think you
can do it try doing 220Km/h in a car sticking your head out the window and talking to
someone (just dont tell the cops where you got this idea)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>Everyone Plows Into the Ground Like a Sack of Potatoes</b></p>

<p>These days everyone jumps <a HREF="terms.htm#Ram Air">ram air</a> canopies
that are far more like an aircraft wing than the old <a HREF="terms.htm#Round">round</a>
canopies you've seen in dozens on world war II movies. These canopies allow everyone (even
first time jumpers) to have gentle tip toe landings - not the crash, thud, roll, ouch
landings suffered by paratroopers.&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p><b>You Can Throw Your Parachute Out and Catch it In Freefall</b><br>
&nbsp; <br>
Arnie and the like might do this in the movies but in reality we like to make sure
everyone has their parachute strapped on securely BEFORE exiting the plane. Things move
really fast in freefall (like about 220Km/h) and catching your parachute, let alone
struggling into the harness, in 40 seconds or so is really unlikely.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>After One Jump You'll Be Skysurfing Like a Pro</b></p>

<p>Sorry, Skydiving is far from an easy sport, skysurfing looks easy on TV because the
people you are watching are experts with thousands of jumps. In reality you probably wont
even strap on a board until you have atleast 100 jumps.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>You Freefall For Five Minutes</b></p>

<p>Chalk another one up to the movies. In real life most skydivers jump from around 10,000
feet. This gives us about 35's of freefall, to get the five minutes or so you see in the
movies we'd need to go to about 60,000 feet which requires lots of warm clothes and oxygen
plus a really looooong time in the plane. Since skydivers are so lazy and hate being in
the plane so much we stick to 10,000 feet.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>Everyone Who Skydives is Insane</b></p>

<p>Despite the common public perception that anyone who jumps out of a perfectly good
aeroplane must be certifiably insane most of us are in fact boringly normal.</p>
