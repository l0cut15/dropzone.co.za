<h3>From Johannesburg:</h3>

<p>Take the N12 highway till the Ogies, Blackhill exit. Take the exit ramp and turn right
(beware down this road as it is quite potholed). Drive 16 Km into Witbank then go through
two sets of traffic lights and the road veers to the right, parallel to the railroad
track. Follow this road straight ahead until it splits to the left for the rail crossing,
go left over the railway tracks and follow the sealed road for about 5 km past the small
industrial area and abattoir on the right. The dropzone is at the airfield on the right.
If you reach the prison or run out of tarred road you have gone too far. </p>

<h3>From Pretoria:</h3>

<p>Take the N4 highway until the Eadie Road exit at Witbank. Turn left into Eadie Road. Go
through two sets of traffic lights and the road veers to the right, parallel to the
railroad track. Follow this road straight ahead until it splits to the left for the rail
crossing, go left over the railway tracks and follow the sealed road for about 5 km past
the small industrial area and abattoir on the right. The dropzone is at the airfield on
the right. If you reach the prison or run out of tarred road you have gone too far.</p>
