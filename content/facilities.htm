<p>Because of the distance from
Johannesburg and Pretoria (about 120Km from both, click <a HREF="directions.htm">here</a><a href="/scripts/gallery/enlarge.asp?filename=/uploads/Images/10/WSC_Roofs.jpg" alt="View From Above" target="_blank"></a>
for directions) most people like to make a weekend out of their trip to Witbank and stay
the Saturday night at the club (the real hard core arrive on Friday afternoon so they can
get in two nights of partying and lots of skydives). The club has a pile of matresses,
which anyone can use for sleeping in the clubhouse overnight, these are available on a
 <a href="/scripts/gallery/enlarge.asp?filename=/uploads/Images/10/WSC_Roofs.jpg" alt="View From Above" target="_blank"></a>
strictly first come first serve basis. Alternatively you may bring your own tent and pitch
it on the drop zone. Hot showers and toilet facilities are available in the main
clubhouse. </p>

<p align="left">We have a large braai area which gets used every weekend and braai packs
may be purchased from our lovely food/bar lady, Pauline (get
in early though). Pauline also supplies hamburgers, cooldrinks and chocolates during the
day and once the jumping is finished she runs the always popular bar, supplying beer and
spirits. For those not in to roughing it Witbank is a large town with motels and
restaurants available (you don't know what you will be missing though). </p>
