<p>Why AAD's ARE Dangerous! </p>

<p>Recently, a group of us planned to do a night big way to break off at 4000 feet just
above the storm clouds. The dive went great, even the two way my friend and I normally do
with the remaining altitude. The two way was planned to break high around 1000 feet to
allow sufficient altitude to build a two-stack in the adverse weather conditions. Because
this was my first jump with my new AAD I owed the drop zone a case of beer which my friend
and I drank the beer before the jump. Since I had a few in me, I forgot about my newly
installed Cypres. As I tracked away, I suddenly found myselft under my reserve just as I
went to throw out my pilot chute. Luckily I managed to hold onto it and safely stowed it
behind my container. This further endangered me when I docked on my friend. The flight
characteristics of our canopies were very different. My reserve about wrapped around his
lines! I ended up spraining my ankle because my reserve collapsed after brushing power
lines my friend and I flew into due to the fog. </p>

<p>If a worse incident would have occured, my AAD would have been totally responsible. It
was the thorough instruction of my jumpmasters on tracking and reserve CRW that saved me
from even worse injuries. The very next day, I sold my AAD. I also started wearing a hook
knife that my friend or I could use in the event of a wrap. </p>

<p>I recommend that AAD's be made illegal as they may be responsible for more incidents
than saves. </p>

<p>Why packing doesn't matter. </p>

<p>First, I would like to thank my jumpmasters for informing me on the insignificance of
packing. I have seen so many other students worry about this, like it was important. Now I
am on sort of a crusade to alleviate other beginners like me of any such concerns. I show
them how messy I can pack my rig with lines and canopy all over the place. Usually I can't
even get my zero-p parachute all the way into the rig. The lines and canopy hang out
between the flaps and it still opens fine. I have started packing all their rigs as sloppy
and quick as I can to help them get over their &quot;gear fear.&quot; Most of them pack
the same way now and thank me for comforting them. My jumpmasters warn all the beginners
not to do gear checks because it will just cause them to become paranoid. Skydiving should
be fun and relaxing for everyone. Any added nervousness to new jumpers will make them more
dangerous to themselves and others. </p>

<p>The more we do to demonstrate the reliability of the skydiving equipment, the more
confident new jumpers will feel. Once, one of my jumpmasters slid a thin metal rod through
my reserve closing loop and didn't tell me until I was done jumping for the day. My friend
and I had logged four CRW jumps and a &quot;horny-gorilla&quot;. All of our pack jobs
really looked scary too. I am much more confident of my equipment now. </p>

<p>Last weekend my jumpmasters let me repack all the tandem reserves. I had never even
seen a reserve packed before, but I managed to cram them in there somehow. Possibly this
weekend, one of the tandem instructors will intentionally cut away so that they can test
my pack job. I am sure after all is said and done, we will all be much more comfortable
with our gear. </p>

<p>So just as a recommendation to all the jumpmasters and instructors out there, please
inform all your students that packing really doesn't matter. It will make them much more
comfortable with their gear and a better skydiver in the long run. Also, warn against gear
checks until they get at least an A license. </p>

<p>Safely Performing an Instant Downplane </p>

<p>Well, it feels good to be back skydiving after my last injury due to my AAD. I took the
cypress out myself and had a hell of a time cramming my reserve back in the container.
That is better than paying a rigger. </p>

<p>Since I needed to do a hop-and-pop for recurrency, my friend and I decided to so an
instant downplane. We needed compatible canopies so we borrowed our jumpmaster's stiletto
120 and saber 120. Because these are high performance canopies, we figured we had to tie
ourselves together in order to hold a downplane. In the airplane, I tied my friend's feet
to my leg straps. We exited a Mr. Bill around 2500 feet where I deployed my canopy first.
Luckily my friend was not wearing a helmet because when I drug him out on exit, he scraped
and banged his head against the door. Had he been wearing a helmet, his head would
probably have gotten caught in the door with me tied to his feet. We went off tumbling so
I deployed my saber before we got too much air speed. We had a beautiful opening despite
our instability. My friend then pulled out his canopy he free packed with no slider for
the instant downplane. I am not quite sure how or why, but his canopy spun up into mine
and we wrapped. Luckily we were still above 1500 feet so he cut his canopy away and it
managed to free itself from my canopy. Since I figured out how to pack the reserve on my
rig, I told him I would pack his reserve if he used it for the instant down plane. He then
deployed his reserve and it opened. Luckily, it was a PD 126 so we were still somewhat
compatible. This time we went into an awesome downplane. There was no way we could have
held on without being tied together. The tension in the rope and our vertical speed was
incredible! At around 500 feet, my friend pulled out his knife to cut the rope, but the
idiot dropped it! Not knowing how to land a downplane, I cut away my main. My friend and I
were screaming out of the sky under his reserve. Fortunately my friend flew over to a pond
next to our DZ where we safely landed. It was a great jump and I learned a lot from it. In
summary I learned... </p>

<p>1) Each jumper should have a hook knife or have enough to share. <br>
2) Make the connecting rope releasable. <br>
3) Use a reserve that is compatible with your main. <br>
4) Don't use helmets when there is a chance you may get hung up. <br>
5) Always consult your jumpmasters before each jump. <br>
6) Allow plenty of altitude for such maneuvers (i.e. 2500 ft). </p>

<p>Wow, </p>

<p>Since I am nearing 100 jumps, my jumpmasters let me take a first time static line
student. Her name was Erin, and boy was she hot! My dropzone has a quick questionnaire we
give all first timers before they jump. I wouldn't have wasted her time, but I wanted to
stare at her while she filled it out. I recommend this same questionnaire to all
dropzones. </p>

<p>1) What is your name? <br>
2) Have you made any previous skydives? <br>
3) Have you had any hard alcohol or imported beers in the last 24 hours? <br>
4) Are you sick? <br>
5) Do you know what a ripcord is? <br>
6) Are you scared to jump? <br>
7) Do you think you will chicken out? <br>
8) Have you ever played Russian roulette? <br>
9) Describe any skydiving nightmares you may have had. <br>
10) Who is your benefactor. </p>

<p>She filled it out and man was she beautiful. My jumpmasters said since she knew what a
ripcord was and probably wouldn't chicken out, she didn't need much training. That was
great because I wasn't totally sure what to tell her anyway. I took her outside and showed
her the airplane, a Cesna 182. We had plenty of time because the pilot was still passed
out from partying with us the night before. I told her to do a somersault and said
&quot;If you land hard, just do that.&quot; My drop zone has a special harness that we can
hang the students from to practice emergency procedures. I didn't feel this was necessary,
but we had lots of time and she was really cute. I hung her up an showed her the standard
peel-punch-pull technique. </p>

<p>To test her, I called both my jumpmasters over. At the same time, we all started
screaming &quot;MALFUNCTION!!! YOU DUMB B-TCH!!! YOU ARE GOING TO DIE!!! DO SOMETHING!!!
YOU'RE GOING IN!!!&quot; She didn't pull a single handle and started to cry. I felt bad
and took her out of the harness. Then we just sat around until our lazy pilot woke up. I
asked her stuff about her boyfriend and where she went to highschool. </p>

<p>Finally our pilot was ready to go. I went and got her rig. I dressed her in her jump
suit, very slowly. My god was she awesome looking. Then I put the rig on her. She noticed
that there was a bunch of her canopy sticking out from the flaps. I assured that was
normal. I had packed it myself. I couldn't find the bag with the helmets, radios, and
altimeters. My jumpmasters told me just to let her out around 1000 ft so that stuff really
wouldn't matter. On the way out to the airplane I noticed a rope s-folded across the back
of her rig. I had never seen this. I was too embarrassed to ask what it was. We got in the
airplane. On our way to altitude, I figured out that the long rope was acting like a
ripcord. Now I was confident. The pilot had asked me what the winds were. I remembered
they were out of the east yesterday so we took that jumprun. She was shaking really bad in
the airplane, I guess very scared. I had no idea how to calm her down so I just kept
staring at her chest. The pilot opened the door and I hooked the end of her rope to my leg
strap. I told her to get out and jump. I guess the rig was too heavy for her because she
didn't move. I lifted her up and pushed her out of the door. The rope about pulled me out
of the airplane with her, but I held on. There has to be a better system for that. I
packed her a real slow comfortable opening. It opened beautifully. I pulled the rope into
the Cesna and I got out. </p>

<p>Everything went very smooth. My jumpmasters were very proud and I was happy. This was a
very rewarding experience and I do plan to get my jumpmaster rating soon. </p>

<p>Yahoo! It is 1996; a whole new year to skydive. My drop zone had an awesome New Year's
Eve Party. We all came in costume. Recently, a good friend of the drop zone died doing a
normal relative work jump at another drop zone. My jumpmasters said it would be funny if I
dressed up as that person, so I did. I wore a smashed head rubber mask, an old ripped
jumpsuit, lots of fake blood, and fake bones sticking out of my skin. I was shocked at
everybody's reaction. They were actually offended and scorned me! I could not believe
their oversensitivity. Most ended up leaving, so my jumpmasters and I partied without
them. We had all the beer to ourselves. We got so drunk that one of my jumpmasters
couldn't even get his rig on to jump with us at midnight. The uppers were incredibly
strong so we did a cross country. The only thing lit was a few houses and our drop zone
about ten miles away. It was very beautiful and the most peaceful feeling I ever had. My
jumpmasters let me use an old ParaCommander they found when they were cleaning up for the
party. I never jumped a round canopy before so I was naturally excited. I think if I
jumped them a lot, I could become bored, but the ride was incredible for me. It was very
quite and cold. I forgot to put on my jacket before we left. The toggle pressure was a bit
heavier than my canopy and not too responsive. What did I expect? It was a PC. I had no
control over the canopy. I ended up landing in a small field some distance from the dz. I
didn't see all the power lines until I drove by the next day. Next time I do a night cross
county in heavy winds with a PC, I will spot much better. </p>

<p>HAPPY NEW YEAR!! </p>

<p>Also confused on this issue I talked to my jumpmasters. They told me that seperation
between groups has nothing to do with air or ground speed. It only has to do with the size
of the canopies. Jumpers with larger canopies should exit first and open higher. This
allows for the smaller canopies to open lower and out of the way. Since I jump a stilleto
120, it is safest if I exit near last and free fall to around 1000 ft agl. They further
said that horizontal seperation can only lead to bad a bad spot for more jumpers. </p>

<p align="center">I was asked by my jumpmasters to post something about the &quot;case of
beer&quot; thing. Beer is a crucial part of our sport. A full beer has a very compatible
fall rate. At my drop zone, no student can graduate until they catch the full beer can
thrown three seconds prior to their exit. In addition, all those empty beer cans
constantly pushed out of the way while trying to sit down in the aircraft, make great wind
drift indicators if you actually choose to spot. Requiring a case of beer for a first, is
as important to our sport as is the parachute. My jumpmasters told me that the people who
don't like the case of beer rule probably do freestyle. Beer helps many nervous jumpers
relax and enjoy their skydive. Any time a student is particularly scared, my jumpmasters
drink beer with them until they are ready to make the jump. Without beer, how many of us
would be jumping today? Beer is to skydiving like shoes are to feet. Would you really want
to walk without at least having two. If you deny the sport beer, than you are contributing
to its eventual demise. <a HREF="humor.htm#TOP">BACK TO TOP OF PAGE</a> </p>

<p>This weekend I decided to try to dock on a tandem that my jumpmaster was doing, so I
borrowed his stiletto which was a bit bigger than mine. I figured I would need it. We got
to altitude pretty quick. I had to estimate where we were because someone spilled beer on
our GPS at lunch and I couldn't see through the cloud layer. The tandem jumped and I
chased. There was an amazing amount of tension in the drogue chute bridal. It felt like a
stiff metal rod. It was cool because I could climb up and down easily from my jumpmaster
to the drogue chute. At around 4000 ft, I got off and deployed so that the passenger could
watch my deployment. The tandem pulled a little high and was under canopy by 3000 ft so we
would had plenty of time for me to dock and try to land the stack. I front-risered all the
way down to them, but had way too much forward speed. My canopy wrapped around the tandem.
It was funny because I could here the tandem passenger screaming. I hate it when girls
scream like that. My canopy was somehow caught between my jumpmaster and the passenger. My
jumpmaster could not get clear so he told me to cut away. I cut away and deployed my
reserve. I landed in a small field about five miles from the DZ because of the spot. I was
laughing so hard because I could still here her screaming. I couldn't see them until they
were below the clouds and about to land. It was a fun jump. I never found my freebag, but
my jumpmaster managed to hold onto my canopy. A car stopped to give me a ride so I didn't
look for the tandem. My jumpmaster got back before I did and she left right away. If
anyone knows who she is, let me know. Usually I get girls' phone numbers off of the
waivers, but she didn't fill one out. She was very cute and I would really like to meet
her. If anyone knows who she is, please e-mail me. </p>

<p>I just moved my computer to my drop zone since I spend most of my time there anyway.
This means that my jumpmasters and I can post more often. Right now we are all just
drinking beer because some people are coming out later to do night jumps with us. Anyway,
this last weekend, my jumpmasters invented a new form of skydiving, &quot;Sky
Boxing&quot;. Both of my jumpmasters put on boxing gloves in the airplane. A friend did
video and I acted as referee. My job was to make sure there was no hugging or low punches.
I also had to deploy for them at 2000 ft. since they couldn't with the gloves on. They
went for three rounds last Sunday and it made for a great time watching the videos that
night. To keep the fights close, the winner had to shotgun three beers between rounds. The
trick seemed to be to punch the opponents goggles off and then hit him in the nose to get
his eyes watering. Really hard punches were the funniest because they would both flip or
spin. Anyway, we are thinking about organizing a boxing boogie some time. My jumpmasters
were getting pretty good. If anyone wants to challenge them, please let us know. If you
are going to try this, get video and make sure there is someone to deploy for the boxers.
I made sure they were both under canopy by at least 1000 ft. </p>

<p>Hi Guys, </p>

<p>Just thought I'd take this opportunity to thank all the participants of the &quot;We
Don't Need No Stinkin' Booties&quot; throw down 8 way CReW Team. The Canopies Flown
consisted of everything from a Manta 288 sq. ft. loaded @.9 to 1 to a Stiletto 120 loaded
at 1.6 to 1. While some might say these canopies won't fly well together we set out to
prove them wrong or die trying. </p>

<p>While on the ride to altitude we were voted most likely to die. </p>

<p>Dive One: </p>

<p>Exit order by canopy was Fury 220, Falcon 215, Manta 288, Sabre 170 Griffin 150, Sabre
150, Stiletto 120, Viper 120 We tried to build an 8 stack, (would've been a DZ record I'm
ashamed to say, but they don't do much CReW at this DZ) but it only built to 5 seems it
takes a little planning and practice to get this mis-match to fly together but this dive
proves it can be done. </p>

<p>Dive Two: </p>

<p>Same exit We talked about the dive on the ride to altitude, and decided to build two
four stacks and then dock one one the other. The two stacks built well by 8k, but the
pilot of the high performance stack kept flying away from the others. We broke @ 4k to
build 4 downplane/dragplanes. </p>

<p>Funny but the two 4 stacks seemed to have very similar flight characteristics. I
believe one more attempt would have gotten the DZ record, but the second otter fired up
and the DZ has a rule, no CReW when there are two airplanes flying. All in all it was a
pretty good time the CReW dogs showed the RW godz that they don't always own the sky. </p>

<p>We learned a few things that may come in handy if you try this at your DZ. 

<ol>
  <li>Never discuss the dive till wheels up,too much time to get paranoid is a bad thing.</li>
  <li>When someone asks what'cha got for a main mumble something that sounds like Lightning or
    Prodigy, everyone will be so suprised later.</li>
  <li>Wraps in the ZP/Elliptical stack are much more invigorating but watch out for those
    nasty microlines.</li>
  <li>Never tell the others on the airplane what you are doing. (including the pilot) If they
    find out how much fun CReW is they will all want to do it. And if the pilot knows he'll
    try to screw you on the spot.</li>
  <li>If your DZ outlaws hookturns like ours did just hold your dragplane till 50' or so but
    try not to be on bottom unless you're over water.</li>
  <li>Never allow AAD's on a CReW Dive.</li>
  <li>Off airport landings are common in CReW, be prepared. Always stash full beer coolers in
    fields adjacent to the airport. Also bus tokens can come in handy. Be prepared</li>
  <li>Remember if skydivers flatter you by asking you on a CReW load always accept and if they
    ask you if you've ever done CReW before lie, they did, and who needs safety lectures
    anyway when you have this NG</li>
  <li>If someone cuts away you have to cutaway too nobody, pulls till you turn at least 4
    points, good skydivers stick together.</li>

<p>Yes! It was me that got hurt in Florida and what I learned from my ordeal is to always
follow my gut instincts. I knew AAD's are very dangerous, but I borrowed a rig that had an
AAD and I used it anyway. </p>

<p>We just took off down the runway and were on our way to altitude. To be funny, I told
my jumpmaster to turn on the AAD. That was my mistake. </p>

<p>I was front float on the trail plane of a formation load. It was a good thing that I
was a little drunk because the dive was lousy from the beginning. Our base funneled and a
few of the divers went low. I knew the dive was wasted so I flew under the formation to do
free style where every one could see me. One of my jumpmasters smiled at me and gestured
for me to pull under the formation. So for a joke, I went on my belly, did a nice big slow
wave off and pulled under the formation. The last thing I remember before getting into the
ambulance was very funny. Every one looked so surprised and panicked as they turned to
track away from me. Evidently, during my deployment one of the jumpers hit me, broke most
of my lines, and knocked me unconscious. </p>

<p>I streamered unconscious for over 20 seconds. I was just about to regain consciousness
when the damn AAD fired. The whack of the reserve opening is probably what kept me
unconscious. After a few seconds, my trailing main tangled with power lines and sent me
into the ground very hard. If I did not have that stupid AAD, I could have regained
consciousness, cut the main away, pulled my reserve, and been fine. </p>

<p>So because of my AAD, I now have a few broken ribs, a broken foot, and a broken pelvis.
I will not use an AAD even as a joke any more. </p>

<p>: crwmike,</p>

<p>: Hey. I am going to try to jump with you guys. My jumpmasters made me a<br>
: stereo that fits into my reserve container in place of the reserve so we<br>
: can hear some music during the jump. It's pretty cool. We are thinking<br>
: about marketing the radio.<br>

<p>That would be a mistake, putting a radio in your reserve container.<br>
</p>

<p>The compartment was put there for a reason, and it wasn't for music.<br>
</p>

<p>It's for beer.<br>
</p>

<p>Doing CReW, you can stay up there for a long time. Dehydration is a<br>
serious problem, but it can be prevented by taking proper precautions,<br>
which means taking along an adequate supply of beer.<br>
